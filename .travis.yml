     # The confusing part is that on Travis Linux with YCMD_PYTHON_VERSION=3.3,
     # we build the C++ parts against the below system python3.3, but run
     # against the pyenv python3.3. This is because stupid cmake 2.8.11 has a
     # bug preventing it from finding the pyenv pythons (ostensibly; I haven't
     # checked, but online reports say the issue is gone with cmake 3.4).
     # Everything still works though, it's just weird.
