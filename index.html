</ul><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. It has several completion engines: an identifier-based engine that
works with every programming language, a semantic, <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>-based engine that
provides native semantic code completion for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++
(from now on referred to as "the C-family languages"), a <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a>-based
completion engine for Python, an <a href="https://github.com/nosami/OmniSharpServer">OmniSharp</a>-based completion engine for C#
and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to
provide semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).</p><p><img alt="YouCompleteMe GIF demo" src="http://i.imgur.com/0OP4ood.gif"/></p><p>Here's an explanation of what happens in the short GIF demo above.</p><p>First, realize that <strong>no keyboard shortcuts had to be pressed</strong> to get the list
of completion candidates at any point in the demo. The user just types and the
suggestions pop up by themselves. If the user doesn't find the completion
suggestions relevant and/or just wants to type, they can do so; the completion
engine will not interfere.</p><p>When the user sees a useful completion string being offered, they press the TAB
key to accept it. This inserts the completion string. Repeated presses of the
TAB key cycle through the offered completions.</p><p>If the offered completions are not relevant enough, the user can continue typing
to further filter out unwanted completions.</p><p>A critical thing to notice is that the completion <strong>filtering is NOT based on
the input being a string prefix of the completion</strong> (but that works too). The
input needs to be a <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence">subsequence</a> match</em> of a completion. This is a fancy way
of saying that any input characters need to be present in a completion string in
the order in which they appear in the input. So <code>abc</code> is a subsequence of
<code>xaybgc</code>, but not of <code>xbyxaxxc</code>. After the filter, a complicated sorting system
ranks the completion strings so that the most relevant ones rise to the top of
the menu (so you usually need to press TAB just once).</p><p><strong>All of the above works with any programming language</strong> because of the
identifier-based completion engine. It collects all of the identifiers in the
current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them
when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).</p><p>The demo also shows the semantic engine in use. When the user presses <code>.</code>, <code>-&gt;</code>
or <code>::</code> while typing in insert mode (for C++; different triggers are used for
other languages), the semantic engine is triggered (it can also be triggered
with a keyboard shortcut; see the rest of the docs).</p><p>The last thing that you can see in the demo is YCM's diagnostic display features
(the little red X that shows up in the left gutter; inspired by <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Syntastic</a>)
if you are editing a C-family file. As Clang compiles your file and detects
warnings or errors, they will be presented in various ways. You don't need to
save your file or press any keyboard shortcut to trigger this, it "just happens"
in the background.</p><p>In essence, YCM obsoletes the following Vim plugins because it has all of their
features plus extra:</p><ul>
<li>clang_complete</li>
<li>AutoComplPop</li>
<li>Supertab</li>
<li>neocomplcache</li>
</ul><p>YCM also provides semantic go-to-definition/declaration commands for C-family
languages &amp; Python. Expect more IDE features powered by the various YCM semantic
engines in the future.</p><p>You'll also find that YCM has filepath completers (try typing <code>./</code> in a file)
and a completer that integrates with <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/blob/master/doc/UltiSnips.txt">UltiSnips</a>.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><h3 id="mac-os-x-super-quick-installation">Mac OS X super-quick installation</h3><p>Please refer to the full Installation Guide below; the following commands are
provided on a best-effort basis and may not work for you.</p><p>Install the latest version of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/#Download">MacVim</a>. Yes, MacVim. And yes, the <em>latest</em>.</p><p>If you don't use the MacVim GUI, it is recommended to use the Vim binary that is
inside the MacVim.app package (<code>MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim</code>). To ensure it
works correctly copy the <code>mvim</code> script from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/#Download">MacVim</a> download to your
local binary folder (for example <code>/usr/local/bin/mvim</code>) and then symlink it:</p><pre><code>ln -s /usr/local/bin/mvim vim
</code></pre><p>Install YouCompleteMe with <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle#about">Vundle</a>.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> YCM is a plugin with a compiled component. If you <strong>update</strong> YCM
using Vundle and the ycm_support_libs library APIs have changed (happens
rarely), YCM will notify you to recompile it. You should then rerun the install
process.</p><p>It's recommended that you have the latest Xcode installed along with the latest
Command Line Tools (that you install from within Xcode).</p><p>Install CMake. Preferably with <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, but here's the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">stand-alone
CMake installer</a>.</p><p><em>If</em> you have installed a Homebrew Python and/or Homebrew MacVim, see the <em>FAQ</em>

Mac OS X. My apologies to Windows users, but I don't have a guide for them. The
code is platform agnostic, so if everything is configured correctly, YCM
<em>should</em> work on Windows without issues (but as of writing, it's untested on
that platform).</p><p>See the <em>FAQ</em> if you have any issues.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> YCM is a plugin with a compiled component. If you <strong>update</strong> YCM
using Vundle and the ycm_support_libs library APIs have changed (happens

<li>
<p><strong>Ensure that your version of Vim is <em>at least</em> 7.3.584 <em>and</em> that it has
    support for python2 scripting</strong>.</p>
<p>Inside Vim, type <code>:version</code>. Look at the first two to three lines of output;
it should say <code>Vi IMproved 7.3</code> and then below that, <code>Included patches:
1-X</code>, where X will be some number. That number needs to be 584 or higher.</p>
<p>If your version of Vim is not recent enough, you may need to <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source">compile Vim
from source</a> (don't worry, it's easy).</p>
<p>After you have made sure that you have Vim 7.3.584+, type the following in
Vim: <code>:echo has('python')</code>. The output should be 1. If it's 0, then get a
version of Vim with Python support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install YCM</strong> with <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle#about">Vundle</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#pathogenvim">Pathogen</a>, but Vundle is a better
    idea). With Vundle, this would mean adding a <code>Plugin
    'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'</code> line to your <a href="http://vimhelp.appspot.com/starting.txt.html#vimrc">vimrc</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't install YCM with Vundle, make sure you have run
<code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> after checking out the YCM
repository (Vundle will do this for you) to fetch YCM's dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Complete this step ONLY if you care about semantic completion support for
    C-family languages. Otherwise it's not necessary.]</p>
<p><strong>Download the latest version of <code>libclang</code></strong>. Clang is an open-source
compiler that can compile C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++. The <code>libclang</code>
library it provides is used to power the YCM semantic completion engine for
those languages. YCM is designed to work with libclang version 3.5 or
higher, but can in theory work with any 3.2+ version as well.</p>
<p>You can use the system libclang <em>only if you are sure it is version 3.3 or
higher</em>, otherwise don't. Even if it is, we recommend using the <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.3">official
binaries from llvm.org</a> if at all possible. Make sure you
download the correct archive file for your OS.</p>
<p>We <strong>STRONGLY recommended AGAINST use</strong> of the system libclang instead of
the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself the
hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compile the <code>ycm_support_libs</code> libraries</strong> that YCM needs. These libs
    are the C++ engines that YCM uses to get fast completions.</p>
<p>You will need to have <code>cmake</code> installed in order to generate the required
makefiles. Linux users can install cmake with their package manager (<code>sudo
apt-get install cmake</code> for Ubuntu) whereas other users can <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">download and
install</a> cmake from its project site. Mac users can also get
it through <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> with <code>brew install cmake</code>.</p>
<p>You also need to make sure you have Python headers installed. On a
Debian-like Linux distro, this would be <code>sudo apt-get install python-dev</code>.
On Mac they should already be present.</p>
<p>Here we'll assume you installed YCM with Vundle. That means that the
top-level YCM directory is in <code>~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe</code>.</p>
<p>We'll create a new folder where build files will be placed. Run the
following:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~
mkdir ycm_build
cd ycm_build
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to generate the makefiles. If you DON'T care about semantic
support for C-family languages, run the following command in the <code>ycm_build</code>
directory:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp
</code></pre>
<p>For those who want to use the system version of boost, you would pass
<code>-DUSE_SYSTEM_BOOST=ON</code> to cmake. This may be necessary on some systems
where the bundled version of boost doesn't compile out of the box.</p>
<p>NOTE: We <strong>STRONGLY recommended AGAINST use</strong> of the system boost instead
of the bundled version of boost. Random things may break. Save yourself
the hassle and use the bundled version of boost.</p>
<p>If you DO care about semantic support for C-family languages, then your
<code>cmake</code> call will be a bit more complicated.  We'll assume you downloaded a
binary distribution of LLVM+Clang from llvm.org in step 3 and that you
extracted the archive file to folder <code>~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir</code> (with <code>bin</code>,
<code>lib</code>, <code>include</code> etc. folders right inside that folder). With that in mind,
run the following command in the <code>ycm_build</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp
</code></pre>
<p>Now that makefiles have been generated, simply run:</p>
<pre><code>make ycm_support_libs
</code></pre>
<p>For those who want to use the system version of libclang, you would pass
<code>-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBCLANG=ON</code> to cmake <em>instead of</em> the
<code>-DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=...</code> flag.</p>
<p>NOTE: We <strong>STRONGLY recommended AGAINST use</strong> of the system libclang instead
of the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself
the hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.</p>
<p>You could also force the use of a custom libclang library with
<code>-DEXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/libclang.so</code> flag (the library would end
with <code>.dylib</code> on a Mac). Again, this flag would be used <em>instead of</em> the
other flags.</p>
<p>Running the <code>make</code> command will also place the <code>libclang.[so|dylib]</code> in the
<code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd</code> folder for you if you compiled with clang
support (it needs to be there for YCM to work).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>That's it. You're done. Refer to the <em>User Guide</em> section on how to use YCM.
Don't forget that if you want the C-family semantic completion engine to work,
you will need to provide the compilation flags for your project to YCM. It's all
in the User Guide.</p><p>YCM comes with sane defaults for its options, but you still may want to take a
look at what's available for configuration. There are a few interesting options
that are conservatively turned off by default that you may want to turn on.</p><h2 id="user-guide">User Guide</h2><h3 id="general-usage">General Usage</h3><ul>
<li>If the offered completions are too broad, keep typing characters; YCM will
  continue refining the offered completions based on your input.</li>
<li>Filtering is "smart-case" sensitive; if you are typing only lowercase letters,
  then it's case-insensitive. If your input contains uppercase letters, then the
  uppercase letters in your query must match uppercase letters in the completion
  strings (the lowercase letters still match both). So, "foo" matches "Foo" and
  "foo", "Foo" matches "Foo" and "FOO" but not "foo".</li>
<li>Use the TAB key to accept a completion and continue pressing TAB to cycle
  through the completions. Use Shift-TAB to cycle backwards. Note that if you're
  using console Vim (that is, not Gvim or MacVim) then it's likely that the
  Shift-TAB binding will not work because the console will not pass it to Vim.
  You can remap the keys; see the <em>Options</em> section below.</li>
</ul><p>Knowing a little bit about how YCM works internally will prevent confusion. YCM
has several completion engines: an identifier-based completer that collects all
of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags
files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype
groups).</p><p>There are also several semantic engines in YCM. There's a libclang-based
completer that provides semantic completion for C-family languages.  There's a
Jedi-based completer for semantic completion for Python. There's also an
omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to
provide semantic completions when no native completer exists for that language
in YCM.</p><p>There are also other completion engines, like the UltiSnips completer and the
filepath completer.</p><p>YCM automatically detects which completion engine would be the best in any
situation. On occasion, it queries several of them at once, merges the
outputs and presents the results to you.</p><h3 id="client-server-architecture">Client-server architecture</h3><p>YCM has a client-server architecture; the Vim part of YCM is only a thin client
that talks to the <code>ycmd</code> HTTP+JSON server that has the vast majority of YCM
logic and functionality. The server is started and stopped automatically as you
start and stop Vim.</p><h3 id="completion-string-ranking">Completion string ranking</h3><p>The subsequence filter removes any completions that do not match the input, but
then the sorting system kicks in. It's actually very complicated and uses lots
of factors, but suffice it to say that "word boundary" (WB) subsequence
character matches are "worth" more than non-WB matches. In effect, this means
given an input of "gua", the completion "getUserAccount" would be ranked higher
in the list than the "Fooguxa" completion (both of which are subsequence
matches). A word-boundary character are all capital characters, characters
preceded by an underscore and the first letter character in the completion
string.</p><h3 id="general-semantic-completion-engine-usage">General Semantic Completion Engine Usage</h3><ul>
<li>You can use Ctrl+Space to trigger the completion suggestions anywhere, even
  without a string prefix. This is useful to see which top-level functions are
  available for use.</li>
</ul><h3 id="c-family-semantic-completion-engine-usage">C-family Semantic Completion Engine Usage</h3><p>YCM looks for a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file in the directory of the opened file or
in any directory above it in the hierarchy (recursively); when the file is
found, it is loaded (only once!) as a Python module. YCM calls a <code>FlagsForFile</code>
method in that module which should provide it with the information necessary to
compile the current file. You can also provide a path to a global
<code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file, which will be used as a fallback. To prevent the
execution of malicious code from a file you didn't write YCM will ask you once
per <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> if it is safe to load. This can be disabled and you can
white-/blacklist files. See the <em>Options</em> section for more details.</p><p>This system was designed this way so that the user can perform any arbitrary
sequence of operations to produce a list of compilation flags YCM should hand
to Clang.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/blob/master/cpp/ycm/.ycm_extra_conf.py">See YCM's own <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code></a> for details on how this
works. You should be able to use it <em>as a starting point</em>. <strong>Don't</strong> just
copy/paste that file somewhere and expect things to magically work; <strong>your project
needs different flags</strong>. Hint: just replace the strings in the <code>flags</code> variable
with compilation flags necessary for your project. That should be enough for 99%
of projects.</p><p>Yes, <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html">Clang's <code>CompilationDatabase</code> system</a> is also supported. Again,
see the above linked example file. You can get CMake to generate this file for
you by adding <code>set( CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 1 )</code> to your project's
<code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file (if using CMake). If you're not using CMake, you could use
something like <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a> to generate the <code>compile_commands.json</code> file.</p><p>If Clang encounters errors when compiling the header files that your file
includes, then it's probably going to take a long time to get completions.  When
the completion menu finally appears, it's going to have a large number of
unrelated completion strings (type/function names that are not actually
members). This is because Clang fails to build a precompiled preamble for your
file if there are any errors in the included headers and that preamble is key to
getting fast completions.</p><p>Call the <code>:YcmDiags</code> command to see if any errors or warnings were detected in
your file.</p><h3 id="python-semantic-completion">Python semantic completion</h3><p>YCM uses <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a> to power its semantic completion for Python. This should "just
work" without any configuration from the user. You do NOT need to install Jedi
yourself; YCM uses it as a git subrepo. If you're installing YCM with Vundle
(which is the recommended way) then Vundle will make sure that the subrepo is
checked out when you do <code>:PluginInstall</code>. If you're installing YCM by hand, then
you need to run <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> when you're checking
out the YCM repository. That's it.</p><p>But again, installing YCM with Vundle takes care of all of this for you.</p><h3 id="c-semantic-completion">C# semantic completion</h3><p>YCM uses <a href="https://github.com/nosami/OmniSharpServer">OmniSharp</a> to provide semantic completion for C#. It's used as a git
subrepo. If you're installing YCM with Vundle (which is the recommended way)
then Vundle will make sure that the subrepo is checked out when you do
<code>:PluginInstall</code>. If you're installing YCM by hand, then you need to run <code>git
submodule update --init --recursive</code> when you're checking out the YCM
repository.</p><p>OmniSharp is written in C# and has to be compiled. The <code>install.sh</code> script takes
care of this if you pass <code>--omnisharp-completer</code> as an argument.</p><h3 id="semantic-completion-for-other-languages">Semantic completion for other languages</h3><p>YCM will use your <code>omnifunc</code> (see <code>:h omnifunc</code> in Vim) as a source for semantic
completions if it does not have a native semantic completion engine for your
file's filetype. Vim comes with okayish omnifuncs for various languages like
Ruby, PHP etc. It depends on the language.</p><p>You can get stellar omnifuncs for Java and Ruby with <a href="http://eclim.org/">Eclim</a>. Just make sure
you have the <em>latest</em> Eclim installed and configured (this means Eclim <code>&gt;= 2.2.*</code>
and Eclipse <code>&gt;= 4.2.*</code>).</p><p>After installing Eclim remember to create a new Eclipse project within your
application by typing <code>:ProjectCreate &lt;path-to-your-project&gt; -n ruby</code> (or <code>-n java</code>)
inside vim and don't forget to have <code>let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc'</code>
in your vimrc. This will make YCM and Eclim play nice; YCM will use Eclim's omnifuncs
as the data source for semantic completions and provide the auto-triggering
and subsequence-based matching (and other YCM features) on top of it.</p><h3 id="writing-new-semantic-completers">Writing New Semantic Completers</h3><p>You have two options here: writing an <code>omnifunc</code> for Vim's omnicomplete system
that YCM will then use through its omni-completer, or a custom completer for YCM
using the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/blob/master/ycmd/completers/completer.py">Completer API</a>.</p><p>Here are the differences between the two approaches:</p><ul>
<li>You have to use VimScript to write the omnifunc, but get to use Python to
  write for the Completer API; this by itself should make you want to use the
  API.</li>
<li>The Completer API is a <em>much</em> more powerful way to integrate with YCM and it
  provides a wider set of features. For instance, you can make your Completer
  query your semantic back-end in an asynchronous fashion, thus not blocking
  Vim's GUI thread while your completion system is processing stuff. This is
  impossible with VimScript. All of YCM's completers use the Completer API.</li>
<li>Performance with the Completer API is better since Python executes faster than
  VimScript.</li>
</ul><p>If you want to use the <code>omnifunc</code> system, see the relevant Vim docs with <code>:h
complete-functions</code>. For the Completer API, see <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/blob/master/ycmd/completers/completer.py">the API docs</a>.</p><p>If you want to upstream your completer into YCM's source, you should use the
Completer API.</p><h3 id="diagnostic-display">Diagnostic display</h3><p>YCM will display diagnostic notifications for C-family and C# languages if you
compiled YCM with Clang and Omnisharp support, respectively. Since YCM continuously
recompiles your file as you type, you'll get notified of errors and warnings
in your file as fast as possible.</p><p>Here are the various pieces of the diagnostic UI:</p><ul>
<li>Icons show up in the Vim gutter on lines that have a diagnostic.</li>
<li>Regions of text related to diagnostics are highlighted (by default, a red
  wavy underline in <code>gvim</code> and a red background in <code>vim</code>).</li>
<li>Moving the cursor to a line with a diagnostic echoes the diagnostic text.</li>
<li>Vim's location list is automatically populated with diagnostic data (off by
  default, see options).</li>
</ul><p>The new diagnostics (if any) will be displayed the next time you press any key
on the keyboard. So if you stop typing and just wait for the new diagnostics to
come in, that <em>will not work</em>. You need to press some key for the GUI to update.</p><p>Having to press a key to get the updates is unfortunate, but cannot be changed
due to the way Vim internals operate; there is no way that a background task can
update Vim's GUI after it has finished running.  You <em>have to</em> press a key. This
will make YCM check for any pending diagnostics updates.</p><p>You <em>can</em> force a full, blocking compilation cycle with the
<code>:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics</code> command (you may want to map that command to a
key; try putting <code>nnoremap &lt;F5&gt; :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics&lt;CR&gt;</code> in your
vimrc). Calling this command will force YCM to immediately recompile your file
and display any new diagnostics it encounters. Do note that recompilation with
this command may take a while and during this time the Vim GUI <em>will</em> be
blocked.</p><p>YCM will display a short diagnostic message when you move your cursor to the
line with the error. You can get a detailed diagnostic message with the
<code>&lt;leader&gt;d</code> key mapping (can be changed in the options) YCM provides when your
cursor is on the line with the diagnostic.</p><p>You can also see the full diagnostic message for all the diagnostics in the
current file in Vim's <code>locationlist</code>, which can be opened with the <code>:lopen</code> and
<code>:lclose</code> commands (make sure you have set <code>let
g:ycm_always_populate_location_list = 1</code> in your vimrc). A good way to toggle
the display of the <code>locationlist</code> with a single key mapping is provided by
another (very small) Vim plugin called <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ListToggle">ListToggle</a> (which also makes it
possible to change the height of the <code>locationlist</code> window), also written by
yours truly.</p><h4 id="c-diagnostic-support">C# Diagnostic Support</h4><p>Unlike the C-family diagnostic support, the C# diagnostic support is not a full
compile run. Instead, it is a simple syntax check of the current file <em>only</em>.
The <code>:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics</code> command also is only a simple syntax check,
<em>not</em> a compile. This means that only syntax errors will be displayed, and not
semantic errors. For example, omitting the semicolon at the end of statement
will be displayed as a diagnostic error, but using a nonexistent class or
variable will not be.</p><h4 id="diagnostic-highlighting-groups">Diagnostic highlighting groups</h4><p>You can change the styling for the highlighting groups YCM uses. For the signs
in the Vim gutter, the relevant groups are:</p><ul>
<li><code>YcmErrorSign</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticErrorSign</code> and then
  <code>error</code> if they exist</li>
<li><code>YcmWarningSign</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticWarningSign</code> and then
  <code>todo</code> if they exist</li>
</ul><p>You can also style the line that has the warning/error with these groups:</p><ul>
<li><code>YcmErrorLine</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticErrorLine</code> if it exists</li>
<li><code>YcmWarningLine</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticWarningLine</code> if it
  exists</li>
</ul><p>Note that the line highlighting groups only work when gutter signs are turned
on.</p><p>The syntax groups used to highlight regions of text with errors/warnings:
- <code>YcmErrorSection</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticError</code> if it exists and
  then <code>SpellBad</code>
- <code>YcmWarningSection</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticWarning</code> if it exists
  and then <code>SpellCap</code></p><p>Here's how you'd change the style for a group:</p><pre><code>highlight YcmErrorLine guibg=#3f0000

(for example <code>ft=cpp</code>), else the native completer of the current buffer will be
used.
Call <code>YcmCompleter</code> without further arguments for information about the

C/C++/Objective-C one.</p><p>You may also want to map the subcommands to something less verbose; for
instance, <code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;jd :YcmCompleter GoTo&lt;CR&gt;</code>
maps the <code>&lt;leader&gt;jd</code> sequence to the longer subcommand invocation.</p><p>The various <code>GoTo*</code> subcommands add entries to Vim's <code>jumplist</code> so you can use

handy; it's a way of sending data from Vim to your <code>FlagsForFile</code> function in
your <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file.</p><p>This option is supposed to be a list of VimScript expression strings that are
evaluated for every request to the <code>ycmd</code> server and then passed to your
<code>FlagsForFile</code> function as a <code>client_data</code> keyword argument.</p><p>For instance, if you set this option to <code>['v:version']</code>, your <code>FlagsForFile</code>
function will be called like this:</p><pre><code class="python"># The '704' value is of course contingent on Vim 7.4; in 7.3 it would be '703'
FlagsForFile(filename, client_data = {'v:version': 704})

their values at the time of the request.</p><p>The correct way to define parameters for your <code>FlagsForFile</code> function:</p><pre><code class="python">def FlagsForFile(filename, **kwargs):

the user accepts the offered completion string. If there is no <code>preview</code> window
triggered because there is no <code>preview</code> string in <code>completeopt</code>, this option is
irrelevant. See the <code>g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt</code> option for more details.</p><p>Default: <code>0</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion = 0

string. Invoking any of them repeatedly cycles backwards through the completion
list.</p><p>Note that one of the defaults is <code>&lt;S-TAB&gt;</code> which means Shift-TAB. That mapping
will probably only work in GUI Vim (Gvim or MacVim) and not in plain console Vim
because the terminal usually does not forward modifier key combinations to Vim.</p><p>Default: <code>['&lt;S-TAB&gt;', '&lt;Up&gt;']</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_key_list_previous_completion = ['&lt;S-TAB&gt;', '&lt;Up&gt;']

semantic completion. By default, semantic completion is trigged automatically
after typing <code>.</code>, <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>::</code> in insert mode (if semantic completion support
has been compiled in). This key mapping can be used to trigger semantic
completion anywhere. Useful for searching for top-level functions and classes.</p><p>Console Vim (not Gvim or MacVim) passes <code>&lt;Nul&gt;</code> to Vim when the user types
<code>&lt;C-Space&gt;</code> so YCM will make sure that <code>&lt;Nul&gt;</code> is used in the map command when
you're editing in console Vim, and <code>&lt;C-Space&gt;</code> in GUI Vim. This means that you
can just press <code>&lt;C-Space&gt;</code> in both console and GUI Vim and YCM will do the right
thing.</p><p>Setting this option to an empty string will make sure no mapping is created.</p><p>Default: <code>&lt;C-Space&gt;</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_key_invoke_completion = '&lt;C-Space&gt;'

</code></pre><h3 id="the-gycm_global_ycm_extra_conf-option">The <code>g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf</code> option</h3><p>Normally, YCM searches for a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file for compilation flags
(see the User Guide for more details on how this works). This option specifies
a fallback path to a config file which is used if no <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> is
found.</p><p>You can place such a global file anywhere in your filesystem.</p><p>Default: <code>''</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = ''
</code></pre><h3 id="the-gycm_confirm_extra_conf-option">The <code>g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf</code> option</h3><p>When this option is set to <code>1</code> YCM will ask once per <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file
if it is safe to be loaded. This is to prevent execution of malicious code
from a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file you didn't write.</p><p>To selectively get YCM to ask/not ask about loading certain <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code>
files, see the <code>g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist</code> option.</p><p>Default: <code>1</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf = 1
</code></pre><h3 id="the-gycm_extra_conf_globlist-option">The <code>g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist</code> option</h3><p>This option is a list that may contain several globbing patterns. If a pattern
starts with a <code>!</code> all <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> files matching that pattern will be
blacklisted, that is they won't be loaded and no confirmation dialog will be
shown. If a pattern does not start with a <code>!</code> all files matching that pattern
will be whitelisted. Note that this option is not used when confirmation is
disabled using <code>g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf</code> and that items earlier in the list
will take precedence over the later ones.</p><p>Rules:</p><ul>
<li><code>*</code>       matches everything</li>
<li><code>?</code>       matches any single character</li>
<li><code>[seq]</code>   matches any character in seq</li>
<li><code>[!seq]</code>  matches any char not in seq</li>
</ul><p>Example:</p><pre><code>let g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist = ['~/dev/*','!~/*']
</code></pre><ul>
<li>The first rule will match everything contained in the <code>~/dev</code> directory so
  <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> files from there will be loaded.</li>
<li>The second rule will match everything in the home directory so a
  <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file from there won't be loaded.</li>
<li>As the first rule takes precedence everything in the home directory excluding
  the <code>~/dev</code> directory will be blacklisted.</li>
</ul><p>NOTE: The glob pattern is first expanded with Python's <code>os.path.expanduser()</code>
and then resolved with <code>os.path.abspath()</code> before being matched against the
filename.</p><p>Default: <code>[]</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist = []
</code></pre><h3 id="the-gycm_filepath_completion_use_working_dir-option">The <code>g:ycm_filepath_completion_use_working_dir</code> option</h3><p>By default, YCM's filepath completion will interpret relative paths like <code>../</code>
as being relative to the folder of the file of the currently active buffer.
Setting this option will force YCM to always interpret relative paths as being
relative to Vim's current working directory.</p><p>Default: <code>0</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_filepath_completion_use_working_dir = 0
</code></pre><h3 id="the-gycm_semantic_triggers-option">The <code>g:ycm_semantic_triggers</code> option</h3><p>This option controls the character-based triggers for the various semantic
completion engines. The option holds a dictionary of key-values, where the keys
are Vim's filetype strings delimited by commas and values are lists of strings,
where the strings are the triggers.</p><p>Setting key-value pairs on the dictionary <em>adds</em> semantic triggers to the
internal default set (listed below). You cannot remove the default triggers,
only add new ones.</p><p>A "trigger" is a sequence of one or more characters that trigger semantic
completion when typed. For instance, C++ (<code>cpp</code> filetype) has <code>.</code> listed as a
trigger. So when the user types <code>foo.</code>, the semantic engine will trigger and
serve <code>foo</code>'s list of member functions and variables. Since C++ also has <code>-&gt;</code>
listed as a trigger, the same thing would happen when the user typed <code>foo-&gt;</code>.</p><p>It's also possible to use a regular expression as a trigger. You have to prefix
your trigger with <code>re!</code> to signify it's a regex trigger. For instance,
<code>re!\w+\.</code> would only trigger after the <code>\w+\.</code> regex matches.</p><p>NOTE: The regex syntax is <strong>NOT</strong> Vim's, it's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax">Python's</a>.</p><p>Default: <code>[see next line]</code></p><pre><code>let g:ycm_semantic_triggers =  {

they might not produce all possible results for a given prefix. By unsetting
this option you can ensure that the omnicompletion engine is requeried on every

in the <code>ycmd</code> server. So the magic <code>vim</code> module you could have previously
imported in your <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> files doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>To be fair, importing the magic <code>vim</code> module in extra conf files was never
supported in the first place; it only ever worked by accident and was never a
part of the extra conf API.</p><p>But fear not, you should be able to tweak your extra conf files to continue
working by using the <code>g:ycm_extra_conf_vim_data</code> option. See the docs on that
option for details.</p><h3 id="on-very-rare-occasions-vim-crashes-when-i-tab-through-the-completion-menu">On very rare occasions Vim crashes when I tab through the completion menu</h3><p>That's a very rare Vim bug most users never encounter. It's fixed in Vim

not a directory</code>, then feel free to ignore it; it's caused by a limitation of
CMake and is not an issue. Everything should still work fine.</p><h3 id="i-get-a-weird-window-at-the-top-of-my-file-when-i-use-the-semantic-engine">I get a weird window at the top of my file when I use the semantic engine</h3><p>This is Vim's <code>preview</code> window. Vim uses it to show you extra information about
something if such information is available. YCM provides Vim with such extra
information. For instance, when you select a function in the completion list,
the <code>preview</code> window will hold that function's prototype and the prototypes of
any overloads of the function. It will stay there after you select the
completion so that you can use the information about the parameters and their
types to write the function call.</p><p>If you would like this window to auto-close after you select a completion
string, set the <code>g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion</code> option to <code>1</code>
in your <code>vimrc</code> file. Similarly, the <code>g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_insertion</code>
option can be set to close the <code>preview</code> window after leaving insert mode.</p><p>If you don't want this window to ever show up, add <code>set completeopt-=preview</code> to
your <code>vimrc</code>. Also make sure that the <code>g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt</code> option
is set to <code>0</code>.</p><h3 id="it-appears-that-ycm-is-not-working">It appears that YCM is not working</h3><p>In Vim, run <code>:messages</code> and carefully read the output. YCM will echo messages to
the message log if it encounters problems. It's likely you misconfigured
something and YCM is complaining about it.</p><p>Also, you may want to run the <code>:YcmDebugInfo</code> command; it will make YCM spew out
various debugging information, including the compile flags for the file if the
file is a C-family language file and you have compiled in Clang support.</p><h3 id="sometimes-it-takes-much-longer-to-get-semantic-completions-than-normal">Sometimes it takes much longer to get semantic completions than normal</h3><p>This means that libclang (which YCM uses for C-family semantic completion)
failed to pre-compile your file's preamble. In other words, there was an error
compiling some of the source code you pulled in through your header files. I
suggest calling the <code>:YcmDiags</code> command to see what they were.</p><p>Bottom line, if libclang can't pre-compile your file's preamble because there
were errors in it, you're going to get slow completions because there's no AST
cache.</p><h3 id="ycm-auto-inserts-completion-strings-i-dont-want">YCM auto-inserts completion strings I don't want!</h3><p>This means you probably have some mappings that interfere with YCM's internal
ones. Make sure you don't have something mapped to <code>&lt;C-p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;C-x&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;C-u&gt;</code>
(in insert mode).</p><p>YCM <em>never</em> selects something for you; it just shows you a menu and the user has
to explicitly select something. If something is being selected automatically,
this means there's a bug or a misconfiguration somewhere.</p><h3 id="i-get-a-e227-mapping-already-exists-for-blah-error-when-i-start-vim">I get a <code>E227: mapping already exists for &lt;blah&gt;</code> error when I start Vim</h3><p>This means that YCM tried to set up a key mapping but failed because you already
had something mapped to that key combination. The <code>&lt;blah&gt;</code> part of the message
will tell you what was the key combination that failed.</p><p>Look in the <em>Options</em> section and see if any of the default mappings conflict
with your own. Then change that option value to something else so that the
conflict goes away.</p><h3 id="i-get-glibc_2xx-not-found-required-by-libclangso-when-starting-vim">I get <code>'GLIBC_2.XX' not found (required by libclang.so)</code> when starting Vim</h3><p>Your system is too old for the precompiled binaries from llvm.org. Compile

you can use the Vim binary that is inside the MacVim.app package (it's

</code></pre><p>That would be the <strong>correct</strong> output. An example of <strong>incorrect</strong> output would
be the following:</p><pre><code>-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so (found suitable version "2.5.1", minimum required is "2.5")
</code></pre><p>Notice how there's an extra bit of output there, the <code>found suitable version
"&lt;version&gt;"</code> part, where <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is not the same as the version of the
dynamic library. In the example shown, the library is version 2.7 but the second
string is version <code>2.5.1</code>.</p><p>This means that CMake found one version of Python headers and a different
version for the library. This is wrong. It can happen when you have multiple
versions of Python installed on your machine.</p><p>You should probably add the following flags to your cmake call (again, <code>dylib</code>
instead of <code>so</code> on a Mac):</p><pre><code>-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so
</code></pre><p>This will force the paths to the Python include directory and the Python library
to use. You may need to set these flags to something else, but you need to make
sure you use the same version of Python that your Vim binary is built against,
which is highly likely to be the system's default Python.</p><h3 id="i-get-libpython27a--relocation-r_x86_64_32-when-compiling">I get <code>libpython2.7.a [...] relocation R_X86_64_32</code> when compiling</h3><p>The error is usually encountered when compiling YCM on Centos or RHEL. The full
error looks something like the following:</p><pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libpython2.7.a(abstract.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
</code></pre><p>It's possible to get a slightly different error that's similar to the one above.
Here's the problem and how you solve it:</p><p>Your <code>libpython2.7.a</code> was not compiled with <code>-fPIC</code> so it can't be linked into
<code>ycm_core.so</code>.  Use the <code>-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=</code> CMake flag to point it to a <code>.so</code>
version of libpython on your machine (for instance,
<code>-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so</code>). Naturally, this means you'll have
to go through the full installation guide by hand.</p><h3 id="i-get-vim-caught-deadly-signal-segv-on-vim-startup">I get <code>Vim: Caught deadly signal SEGV</code> on Vim startup</h3><p>This can happen on some Linux distros. If you encounter this situation, run Vim
under <code>gdb</code>. You'll probably see something like this in the output when Vim
crashes:</p><pre><code>undefined symbol: clang_CompileCommands_dispose
</code></pre><p>This means that Vim is trying to load a <code>libclang.so</code> that is too old. You need
at least a 3.2 libclang. Some distros ship with a system <code>libclang.so</code> that
identifies itself as 3.2 but is not; it was cut from the upstream sources before
the official 3.2 release and some API changes (like the addition of the
CompileCommands API) were added after their cut.</p><p>So just go through the installation guide and make sure you are using a correct
<code>libclang.so</code>. I recommend downloading prebuilt binaries from llvm.org.</p><h3 id="ycm-does-not-read-identifiers-from-my-tags-files">YCM does not read identifiers from my tags files</h3><p>First, put <code>let g:ycm_collect_identifiers_from_tags_files = 1</code> in your vimrc.</p><p>Make sure you are using <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant Ctags</a> to produce your tags
files since the only supported tag format is the <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/FORMAT">Exuberant Ctags
format</a>. The format from "plain" ctags is NOT supported. The
output of <code>ctags --version</code> should list "Exuberant Ctags".</p><p>Ctags needs to be called with the <code>--fields=+l</code> (that's a lowercase <code>L</code>, not a
one) option because YCM needs the <code>language:&lt;lang&gt;</code> field in the tags output.</p><p>NOTE: Mac OS X comes with "plain" ctags installed by default. <code>brew install
ctags</code> will get you the Exuberant Ctags version.</p><p>Also make sure that your Vim <code>tags</code> option is set correctly. See <code>:h 'tags'</code> for
details. If you want to see which tag files YCM will read for a given buffer,
run <code>:echo tagfiles()</code> with the relevant buffer active. Note that that function
will only list tag files that already exist.</p><h3 id="ctrl-u-in-insert-mode-does-not-work"><code>CTRL-U</code> in insert mode does not work</h3><p>YCM keeps you in a <code>completefunc</code> completion mode when you're typing in insert
mode and Vim disables <code>&lt;C-U&gt;</code> in completion mode as a "feature." Sadly there's
nothing I can do about this.</p><h3 id="ycm-conflicts-with-ultisnips-tab-key-usage">YCM conflicts with UltiSnips TAB key usage</h3><p>YCM comes with support for UltiSnips (snippet suggestions in the popup menu),
but you'll have to change the UltiSnips mappings. See <code>:h UltiSnips-triggers</code> in
Vim for details. You'll probably want to change some/all of the following
options:</p><pre><code>g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger
g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger
g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger
</code></pre><h3 id="why-isnt-ycm-just-written-in-plain-vimscript-ffs">Why isn't YCM just written in plain VimScript, FFS?</h3><p>Because of the identifier completion engine and subsequence-based filtering.
Let's say you have <em>many</em> dozens of files open in a single Vim instance (I often
do); the identifier-based engine then needs to store thousands (if not tens of
thousands) of identifiers in its internal data-structures. When the user types,
YCM needs to perform subsequence-based filtering on <em>all</em> of those identifiers
(every single one!) in less than 10 milliseconds.</p><p>I'm sorry, but that level of performance is just plain impossible to achieve
with VimScript. I've tried, and the language is just too slow. No, you can't get
acceptable performance even if you limit yourself to just the identifiers in the
current file and simple prefix-based filtering.</p><h3 id="why-does-ycm-demand-such-a-recent-version-of-vim">Why does YCM demand such a recent version of Vim?</h3><p>During YCM's development several show-stopper bugs were encountered in Vim.
Those needed to be fixed upstream (and were). A few months after those bugs were
fixed, Vim trunk landed the <code>pyeval()</code> function which improved YCM performance
even more since less time was spent serializing and deserializing data between
Vim and the embedded Python interpreter. A few critical bugfixes for <code>pyeval()</code>
landed in Vim 7.3.584 (and a few commits before that).</p><h3 id="i-get-annoying-messages-in-vims-status-area-when-i-type">I get annoying messages in Vim's status area when I type</h3><p>If you're referring to the <code>User defined completion &lt;bla bla&gt; back at original</code>
and similar, then just update to Vim 7.4.314 (or later) and they'll go away.</p><h3 id="nasty-bugs-happen-if-i-have-the-vim-autoclose-plugin-installed">Nasty bugs happen if I have the <code>vim-autoclose</code> plugin installed</h3><p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate">delimitMate</a> plugin instead. It does the same thing without
conflicting with YCM.</p><h3 id="is-there-some-sort-of-ycm-mailing-list-i-have-questions">Is there some sort of YCM mailing list? I have questions</h3><p>If you have questions about the plugin or need help, please use the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ycm-users">ycm-users</a> mailing list, <em>don't</em> create issues on the tracker. The tracker is
for bug reports and feature requests.</p><h3 id="i-get-an-internal-compiler-error-when-installing">I get an internal compiler error when installing</h3><p>This can be a problem on virtual servers with limited memory. A possible
solution is to add more swap memory. A more practical solution would be to force
the build script to run only one compile job at a time. You can do this by
setting the <code>YCM_CORES</code> environment variable to <code>1</code>. Example:</p><pre><code>YCM_CORES=1 ./install.sh --clang-completer
</code></pre><h3 id="i-get-weird-errors-when-i-press-ctrl-c-in-vim">I get weird errors when I press <code>Ctrl-C</code> in Vim</h3><p><em>Never</em> use <code>Ctrl-C</code> in Vim.</p><p>Using <code>Ctrl-C</code> to exit insert mode in Vim is a bad idea. The main issue here is
that <code>Ctrl-C</code> in Vim doesn't just leave insert mode, it leaves it without
triggering <code>InsertLeave</code> autocommands (as per Vim docs). This is a bad idea and
is likely to break many other things and not just YCM.</p><p>Bottom line, if you use <code>Ctrl-C</code> to exit insert mode in Vim, you're gonna have a
bad time.</p><p>If pressing <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> is too annoying (agreed, it is), we suggest mapping it to
something more convenient. On a QWERTY keyboard, a good pick for the <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> map
is <code>inoremap jk &lt;Esc&gt;</code>. This is right on the home row, it's an incredibly rare
digraph in English and if you ever need to type those two chars in sequence in
insert mode, you just type <code>j</code>, then wait 500ms, then type <code>k</code>.</p><h3 id="why-did-ycm-stop-using-syntastic-for-diagnostics-display">Why did YCM stop using Syntastic for diagnostics display?</h3><p>Previously, YCM would send any diagnostics it would receive from the libclang
semantic engine to Syntastic for display as signs in the gutter, red squiggles
etc. Today, YCM uses its own code to do that.</p><p>Using Syntastic for this was always a kludge. Syntastic assumes its "checker"
plugins behave in a certain way; those assumptions have never fit YCM. For
instance, YCM continuously recompiles your code in the background for C-family
languages and tries to push new diagnostics to the user as fast as possible,
even while the user types.</p><p>Syntastic assumes that a checker only runs on file save ("active" mode) or even
less frequently, when the user explicitly invokes it ("passive" mode). This
mismatch in assumptions causes performance problems since Syntastic code isn't
optimized for this use case of constant diagnostic refreshing.</p><p>Poor support for this use case also led to crash bugs in Vim caused by
Syntastic-Vim interactions (<a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/593">issue #593</a>) and other problems, like
random Vim flickering. Attempts were made to resolve these issues in
Syntastic, but ultimately some of them failed (for various reasons).</p><p>Implementing diagnostic display code directly in YCM resolves all of these
problems. Performance also improved substantially since the relevant code is now
written in Python instead of VimScript (which is very slow) and is tailored only
for YCM's use-cases. We were also able to introduce new features in this area
since we're now not limited to the Syntastic checker API.</p><p>We've tried to implement this in the most backwards-compatible way possible; YCM
options that control diagnostic display fall back to Syntastic options that
control the same concepts if the user has those set.</p><p>Still, some Syntastic-specific configuration you might have had might not
be supported by the new code. Please file issues on the tracker in such
cases; if we find the request to be reasonable, we'll find a way to address it.</p><h3 id="completion-doesnt-work-with-the-c-standard-library-headers">Completion doesn't work with the C++ standard library headers</h3><p>This is caused by an issue with libclang. Compiling from <code>clang</code> the binary uses
the correct default header search paths but compiling from <code>libclang.so</code> does
not. The issue seems to impact some OS's more than others. It appears that OS X
Mavericks in particular has problems with this.</p><p>The current workaround is to call <code>echo | clang -v -E -x c++ -</code> and look at the
paths under the <code>#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:</code> heading. You should take
those paths, prepend <code>-isystem</code> to each individual path and append them all to
the list of flags you return from your <code>FlagsForFile</code> function in your
<code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file.</p><p>See <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/303">issue #303</a> for details.</p><h2 id="contact">Contact</h2><p>If you have questions about the plugin or need help, please use the
